# Linux

## Overview

The UNIX based operating systems (OS) have the following philosophy:

1. write computer programs, that solve a single task, but very efficient 
2. write computer programs, such that they can work together
3. write computer programs, that process simple text streams

Therefore the whole OS is a collection of a zoo of small specialised applications. The combination of all of them creates a complex and mighty system.
The base system of an UNIX-like OS can be used with text based terminals. However, most systems have a graphical system on top.

## Terminal & Shell

A terminal is a device or (nowadays) a computer program that allows the user to interact with a computer. Besides the physical attendence at a terminal, terminal emulators allow to detach that requirement. There are terminal emulator applications that run locally, like Xterm or Konsole, but it is also possible to remotely connect terminals, e.g. with ssh. A command-line shell, or just shell, is a user interface to the terminal and thus the operating system. 

The most popular Linux shells are:
* [Bourne-Again shell (bash)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
* [Z shell (zsh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) + [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

In the following we will focus on the bash shell. This section is meant to only demonstrate some shell capacities.
