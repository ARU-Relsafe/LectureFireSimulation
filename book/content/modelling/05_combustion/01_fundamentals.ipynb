    "A buring candle is a good fire example. Here, once ignited, the flame emitts heat radiation which is absorbed by the candle body. The solid melts and the fluid wax is transported through the wick and evaporates in a endotermic reaction. Through diffusion, the vaporised wax mixes with air and conducts an exothermic reaction, the combustion. The hot combustion products rise and enentually lead to further reactions.\n",
