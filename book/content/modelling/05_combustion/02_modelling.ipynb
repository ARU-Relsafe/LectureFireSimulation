    "A simple combustion modelling approach is the assumption that chemical processes are infinitely fast, the so called mixed-is-burnt model. It is assumed, that the instantaneous thermostatic state is related to a scalar quantity known as mixture fraction $\\mf f =f(\\vec{x},t)$. It is an artificial quantity that describes the mixing of species and varies in space in time. The individual species concentrations are derived from the mixture fraction.\n",

    "Given a reaction volume, with an inflow of two (representative) species, e.g. fuel $\\mf Y_F$ and air $\\mf Y_A$, and an outflow of a mixture $\\mf Y_M$, the mixture fraction $\\mf f$ is defined as\n",

    "Based on that scalar value, the products of the reaction / combustion are determined, as well as the released chemical energy. Following this definition, a volume containing just air leads to $\\mf f=0$ and one with only fuel is represented by $\\mf f=1$. The flame is represented with $\\mf f_{st}$ as the stochiometric mixture of the fuel and the oxydant. In {numref}`fig-comb-mf-table` an example for a simple single step reaction, involving oxygen ($\\mf Y_O$), an inert gas ($\\mf Y_I$), fuel ($\\mf Y_F$), and combustion products ($\\mf Y_P$) is given. \n",
